Reverse mapping, tentatively called reciprocal mapping, identifies and places new structure from B into A, resulting in the target now being (B+A)."@en ,

Being first also means little scrutinized. We hope other scholars of Charles Sanders Peirce (CSP, pronounced \"purse\") contribute with their understandings.

The history of the KBpedia Knowledge Ontology (KKO) also shows periodic, big chunks of change. The ideas behind KKO are grand and encompassing. The writings of CSP are subtle and profound. Further, CSP's writings are still being transcribed and organized, and it is difficult to get what does exist in the literature in electronic form. The net result is sometimes new understandings and change in the upper KKO structure.

Any attempt to capture the ideas of Charles Sanders Peirce or to be guided by an understanding of his teachings is fraught with many difficulties. His views shifted over the years; he was not always in a position to completely explicate his views; and much of his writing still remains untranscribed. Such is the nature of facts trying to lead to truth.

We welcome input at any time about how best to capture Peircean ideas into a computable knowledge graph. Useful input will be readily acknowledged, including in future updates of the KBpedia Knowledge Ontolgy (KKO).

Peircean scholars have been the first source of information here. A good starting point is the entire Peirce category on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Charles_Sanders_Peirce). There are speciality Peircean online sources too numerous to list that are also useful from these starting links.

Another resource is the Peirce online discussion list: http://www.iupui.edu/~arisbe/PEIRCE-L/PEIRCE-L.HTM."""@en ,

It is an amalgam of six of the largest public knowledge bases available -- Wikipedia, DBpedia, Wikidata, GeoNames, OpenCyc and UMBEL. It is designed for mapping and interoperating diverse ontologies to one another. The ultimate objective of KKO is to provide an ontology that surfaces and organizes the features within knowledge bases most useful to machine learning, artificial intelligence, data interoperability and mapping, and fact tagging and extraction.

The design of the KBpedia Knowledge Ontology is informed by the semiotics (theory of signs) articulated by the 19th century American logician, Charles Sanders Peirce. The design is based on the triadic ideas of Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness that informed virtually all of Peirce's formulations in logic and philosophy. 

Peirce's theory of signs reflects a continual process of the understanding of what a sign means evolving through truth-testing and community use and consensus. The ultimate basis of a sign resides in the idea or quality of something (a Firstness), which has a monadic relationship to itself; an object which is described or made evident in relation to these qualities through dyadic relationships (a Secondness); and then which is understood or perceived by an interpretant (a Thirdness), such as an intelligent human being. (Though in broadest terms, semiosis is not limited to human mediation, and may apply to other agents, such as artificial intelligence.) All signs embody all three of these triadic aspects.

Signs build upon signs -- such is the case with human languages and the concepts conveyed by them -- and ultimately are subject to logic and questioning, the results of which may cause the nature of the relationships between these aspects of signs to undergo revision and refinement. Semiosis is thus intimately related to logic and is itself a continuous process.

Words and language are themselves a Thirdness, which is the result of signmaking consensus. The semiotic or signmaking process builds from things as they are or may be to an ability to name and describe them though language -- and then ultimately to reason and argue over them leading to shared understandings, laws and complex notions of human concepts and worldviews. Each successive progression of signs involves this interplay of requisite Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness. This triadic nature of signs provides a coherent way to understand and organize the representation of knowledge at any level."""@en ;

kko:isLike has the semantics of likely identity, but where there is some uncertainty that the two resources indeed refer to the exact same individual with the same identity. Such uncertainty can arise when, for example, common names may be used for different individuals (e.g., John Smith).

Concepts are the most abstract treatment of particulars and types, and are organized not by logically determinable semiosis, but by \"worldviews\" that provide a coherent, but not necessarily decomposable, organization of ideas.

Concepts are organized into schema, which have a kind of hierarchical or taxonomic backbone of sorts, but are ultimately graphs. (Not sure here, but the typologies used for organizing entities are strictly taxonomic, I think.)

Concept structures are most often what is seen in current ontologies, both those of the upper and domain variety.

How we go about constructing the concept schema, let alone whether there will only be a single one or perhaps 2-3, remains to be determined. The basic ideas at present for the first schema are all based on \"bridging from\" or leveraging an existing schema. Possible source schema include:

1) the upper structure of OpenCyc, absent many abstract concepts, entities and entity types
2) an existing organizational structure from Wikipedia. Individual candidates include:
-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Main_topic_classifications
-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fundamental_categories
3) another existing upper ontology, though all I have inspected seemed flawed (as does now OpenCyc to me)
4) an existing KOS system in widespread use, such as UDC, or LCSH (Library of Congress) (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification)
5) some other internal means based on residual RCs with some unknown method.

A logic is sound if all sentences that can be derived are true in the interpretation, and complete if, conversely, all true sentences can be derived.

Knowledge may also emerge when existing assumptions are tested and found to be incorrect. Thus, knowledge is always emerging and our understanding of the world is always fallible. But the discovery and the emergence of new knowledge is always available to any domain of inquiry.

Emergence is central in theories of integrative levels and of complex systems. For instance, the phenomenon of life as studied in biology is an emergent property of chemistry and psychological phenomena emerge from the neurobiological phenomena of living things. Likewise, economic and legal phenomena emerge from psychology.

In philosophy, emergence typically refers to emergentism. Almost all accounts of emergentism include a form of epistemic or ontological irreducibility to the lower levels. In the Peircean sense, the basis for emergence rests in the logic of semiosis and the triadic categories of Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness."""@en ;

It strongly resembles the purely mathematical part of political economy, which is also a theoretical study of advantages. Of the different classes of arguments, abductions are the only ones in which after they have been admitted to be just, it still remains to inquire whether they are advantageous. But since the whole business of heuretic, so far as its theory goes, falls under methodeutic, there is no kind of argumentation that methodeutic can pass over without notice. Nor is methodeutic confined to the consideration of arguments. On the contrary, its special subjects have always been understood to be the definition and division of terms. The formation of systems of propositions, although it has been neglected, should also evidently be included in methodeutic. In its method, methodeutic is less strict than critic.

The purest form (a First) of monads is what CSP called Quality or Feeling. it is the unrealized possiblity or potential of a sensation. (If realized, it becomes Secondness.) CSP maintained (proved) that all complex structures and concepts can be \"decomposed\" to no more than two (Secondenss, or Relations or Facts) or three (Thirdness, or Mediation or Thought) of these monads. The concept of these monads together and in themselves constitutes a monad in that the idea or concept of them stands on its own, and can not be \"decomposed\" to smaller units."@en ;

                           """We can have first, second, and third monads because the idea of the things can be seen as a possibility in itself. As CSP states in CP 1.450: \"The first of these is that any unit (or units) whatsoever contemplated in itself without conscious regard to its parts would, were our sense to respond to it, be seen to embody a monad.\"

Peirce goes on to say (in CP 1.451): \"What has been here affirmed of collections of units is equally true of collections of monads. Namely, any monads may be contemplated together, and in their monadic aspect without regard to the single monads are seen to be one monad. There is thus a relation between monads similar to the relation of a unit to a monad. But there is this difference in the two cases: a monad thus embraced under another monad is so embraced in its very mode of being, while that a unit should be embraced under a monad has no concern with the mode of existence of the unit, which lies in its brute self-identity and otherness from all the rest.\"

What this means is that a *type*, a natural class or natural kind, can itself be represented as a monad when considered in its entirety (as the idea or concept, not as its collection of members). We can thus apply the same idea of dyadic relations as applied to monads as being applicable to the type ideal. This formulation is somewhat akin to the idea of \"punning\" in the OWL 2 language."""@en ;

            skos:editorialNote """It is not unusual to want to treat things either as a class or an instance in an ontology, depending on context. Among other aspects, this is known as metamodeling and it can be accomplished in a number of ways. One of the reasons KKO is modeled using the Web Ontology Language (OWL2) is its ability to provide a neat trick for doing this called “punning“.

Let's take the example of 'trucks' for why we may want to pun.  We may have a category called 'trucks', which may further be split into truck types, brands of trucks, type of engine, and so forth. Yet, when talking about the idea of 'truck', we may want to characterize that a truck is designed primarily for the transport of cargo (as opposed to automobiles for people transport), or that trucks may have different drivers license requirements or different license fees than autos, or certain sizes or weights. These descriptive properties refer to trucks as an instance.

These mixed cases combine both the organization of concepts in relation to one another and with respect to their set members, and with the description and characterization of these concepts as things unto themselves. This is a natural and common way to express most any domain of interest. Where we have different contexts for describing or discussing 'trucks', punning gives us the abiity to model both contexts.

The punning technique works because the IRI for the object ends up being treated as both a concept (class) and an instance (individual). Thus, while the object shares the same IRI, depending on its context, it is evaluated by an OWL reasoner as a different thing (class or individual). The OWL API achieves this by actually writing out the object in both its class view and individual view.

Because of the KKO's role (among others) as a reference structure for mapping and interoperating external data, it is helpful to think of all of the Reference Concepts (RCs) in the system as classes. This can apply to things which are seemingly individuals, such as specific persons or events, because they may be referred to in multiple ways and in multiple contexts. On the other hand, we want to describe and provide characteristics for these RCs, a view best accomplished when the RC is treated as an instance. Thus, all RCs in the KKO are punned.
